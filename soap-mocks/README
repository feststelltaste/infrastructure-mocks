Purpose of this project

	- The main purpose of this project is to mock necessary external soap
	  service dependencies for a project, so that it is possible to run a 
	  project without dependencies to other systems
 
Code formatting

	- Java Conventions Formatting


Add SOAP Mocks

	- There are two ways how to add mocks. The first way (generic soap mocks)
	  is very easy to implement, but limited in its logic. The second one (JaxWs) 
	  is more complicated, but you can add more logic on it using Java implementation.

	* Add Generic Soap Mock

	1. Add a .config file to folder /src/main/resources/generic_soap_mocks like this:
	
	url=/someservice/v1
	responseFile=someservice-v1-response.xml
	requestContains=someId4711
	
	2. Add the response file to be sent also to folder /src/main/resources/generic_soap_mocks
	
	In this case: someservice-v1-response.xml containing the response xml.
		
	That's it!
	
	/soap-mocks/someservice/v1 will serve what you want


	* Add new JAXWS Services

	1. add wsdl to /src/wsdl
	
	2. configure pom.xml and add section
	
		
		<execution>
			<id>HelloServiceWsdl</id>
			<goals>
				<goal>wsimport</goal>
			</goals>
			<configuration>
				<wsdlFiles>
					<wsdlFile>HelloService.wsdl</wsdlFile>
				</wsdlFiles>
				<packageName>soapmocks.generated.helloservice</packageName>
				<!-- Without this, multiple WSDLs won't be processed :( -->
				<staleFile>${project.build.directory}/jaxws/stale/wsdl.HelloServiceWsdl.done</staleFile>
			</configuration>
		</execution>
		
	3. implement PortType (see example HelloWorldServiceMock) using @SoapMocksUrl annotation
